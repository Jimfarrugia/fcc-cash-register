//* Instructions
// Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that
// accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as
// the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

// cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

// The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object
// with a status key and a change key.

// Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer
// is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

// Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the
// value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

// Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in
// coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

//* Thoughts:
// use an object to store note/coin denominations ("PENNY": 0.01).
// subtract price from cash to find change owed.
// loop through cid from highest to lowest denominations.
//   if a denomination is <= change owed and is > 0 within cid,
//   remove one of that denomination from cid and add it to result.change.
// return the appropriate status and change in the result object.

function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  var change;
  return change;
}
